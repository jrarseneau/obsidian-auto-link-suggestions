# Auto Link Suggestions

An Obsidian plugin that automatically suggests note titles as you type and creates wiki-style links to them. Stop manually typing `[[` to create links - just start typing a note name and get intelligent suggestions!

## Features

- **Smart Auto-Complete**: As you type, the plugin automatically suggests matching note titles from your vault
- **Usage-Based Ranking**: Notes you link to frequently appear first in suggestions (learns from your behavior)
- **Recency Weighting**: Boost recently-used notes to prioritize current work over old favorites
- **Time-Based Decay**: Gradually reduce rankings for notes not used recently to keep suggestions fresh
- **Newness Boost**: Temporarily boost recently-created notes to surface fresh content
- **Alias Support**: Includes note aliases from frontmatter in suggestions
- **Flexible Matching**: Choose between matching anywhere in the title or only at the start
- **Customizable Behavior**: Configure minimum trigger length, maximum suggestions, and more
- **Real-time Indexing**: Automatically tracks when notes are created, renamed, or deleted
- **Path Display**: Optionally show file paths to disambiguate notes with similar names

## How It Works

Simply start typing in any note. Once you've typed the minimum number of characters (default: 2), the plugin will show a dropdown menu with matching note titles. Select a suggestion to automatically insert a wiki-style link (`[[Note Title]]`) at your cursor position.

The plugin intelligently:
- Won't trigger if you're already inside a link (between `[[` and `]]`)
- Updates suggestions in real-time as your vault changes
- Matches against both note titles and aliases (if enabled)
- Learns from your selections to rank frequently-used notes higher (when enabled)

## Settings

Access the plugin settings via Settings → Auto Link Suggestions to customize the behavior:

| Setting | Description | Default | Use Case / Notes |
|---------|-------------|---------|------------------|
| **Minimum Characters** | Minimum number of characters you need to type before suggestions appear | 2 | Increase for fewer/more targeted suggestions; decrease to get suggestions sooner |
| **Maximum Suggestions** | Maximum number of suggestions to display in the dropdown menu | 10 | Increase for more options; decrease for a cleaner, faster interface |
| **Case Sensitive** | Whether matching should be case-sensitive | Off | Enable if you have notes with similar names but different capitalization |
| **Match at Start** | Only match note titles that start with your typed text (instead of anywhere in the title) | Off | When off, typing "link" matches "Auto **Link** Suggestions"<br>When on, typing "link" won't match "Auto Link Suggestions" |
| **Include Aliases** | Show note aliases from frontmatter in suggestions | On | If a note has `aliases: [AI]` in frontmatter, typing "AI" will suggest it. Disable to only show actual note titles |
| **Show File Path** | Display the file path below each suggestion in the dropdown | Off | Enable if you have notes with identical titles in different folders and need to distinguish them |
| **Enable Usage-Based Ranking** | Rank suggestions based on how frequently you select them | On | When enabled, notes you link to more often appear first in the dropdown. Perfect for surfacing your most-used references quickly |
| **Enable Recency Boost** | Boost recently-used notes in rankings | On | Prioritizes notes you've linked to recently. A note used yesterday will rank higher than one used months ago, even with the same total usage count |
| **Recency Weight** | Balance between recency and frequency (0-100%) | 30% | Higher values favor recently-used notes more. At 30%, scoring is 70% frequency + 30% recency. At 50%, they're equally weighted |
| **Decay Period (days)** | Days before rankings start to decay | 90 | Notes not used within this period gradually lose ranking (50% reduction over the next period). Prevents old favorites from dominating forever |
| **Enable Newness Boost** | Boost recently-created notes in rankings | On | Gives newly-created notes a temporary ranking boost that fades over time. Perfect for surfacing recent meeting notes, project docs, etc. |
| **Newness Boost Duration (days)** | How long newness boost applies | 30 | Notes created within this period get a boost. A note created today gets maximum boost, fading to zero at this threshold |
| **Newness Boost Strength** | Maximum boost multiplier (0.0-2.0) | 0.5 | At 0.5, brand-new notes get up to 1.5x ranking boost. At 1.0, up to 2.0x. Higher values make new notes more prominent |

## Installation

### From Obsidian Community Plugins (when published)
1. Open Settings → Community plugins
2. Disable Safe mode if needed
3. Click Browse and search for "Auto Link Suggestions"
4. Click Install, then Enable

### Manual Installation
1. Download the latest release from the releases page
2. Extract the files to your vault's plugins folder: `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/auto-link-suggestions/`
3. Reload Obsidian
4. Enable the plugin in Settings → Community plugins

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```
Start typing: "obsid"
Suggestions appear: "Obsidian Tips", "Obsidian Plugins", "Obsidian Workflow"
Select one → automatically inserts: [[Obsidian Tips]]
```

### Usage-Based Ranking
The plugin learns from your selections to improve suggestions over time:

**Initial state** (typing "John"):
- John Doe
- John Smith
- Johnny Appleseed

**After frequently linking to "John Smith"** (typing "John"):
- John Smith ⭐ (appears first due to high usage)
- John Doe
- Johnny Appleseed

The ranking is based on how many times you've selected each note. This makes your most-referenced notes instantly accessible!

### Recency Weighting & Decay
The plugin can also prioritize recently-used notes and decay old rankings:

**Scenario**: You have two notes, both linked 10 times
- "Project Alpha" - Last used 2 days ago
- "Project Beta" - Last used 6 months ago

**With recency boost enabled** (typing "Project"):
- Project Alpha ⭐ (appears first - recently used)
- Project Beta (used long ago)

**After 90 days** (default decay period):
- Notes unused for 90+ days gradually lose ranking (50% reduction over the next 90 days)
- This prevents old projects from cluttering suggestions when you're working on new things
- Frequency still matters - a note used 100 times will rank higher than one used 5 times, even if older

**Configurable weighting**:
- At 30% recency weight (default): 70% frequency + 30% recency
- At 50% recency weight: Equal balance
- At 0% recency weight: Pure frequency-based ranking (like before)

### Newness Boost
The plugin can boost recently-created notes to help surface fresh content:

**Your scenario**: You have notes with "Sandra" in the title
- "Sandra Smith" - Created 2 years ago, linked 50 times
- "Sandra - Coaching Session 2024-11-07" - Created 7 days ago, linked 1 time

**Without newness boost** (typing "Sandra"):
- Sandra Smith (scores very high due to frequency)
- Sandra - Coaching Session 2024-11-07 (may not appear in top suggestions)

**With newness boost enabled** (typing "Sandra"):
- Sandra Smith ⭐ (still high due to frequency)
- Sandra - Coaching Session 2024-11-07 🆕 (boosted up to 1.5x, now visible!)

**How it works**:
- Notes created today: Full boost (e.g., 1.5x with default 0.5 strength)
- Notes created 15 days ago: Half boost (1.25x)
- Notes created 30+ days ago: No boost (1.0x, normal ranking)

This ensures your recent meeting notes, new project documentation, and fresh content appear in suggestions even if they haven't been linked frequently yet. The boost fades over time so established patterns eventually take over.

### With Aliases
If you have a note "Artificial Intelligence.md" with frontmatter:
```yaml
---
aliases: [AI, Machine Learning, ML]
---
```

Typing "AI" will suggest this note, and selecting it creates: `[[AI]]`

### Configuration Scenarios
